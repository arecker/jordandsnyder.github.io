My research interests include global mental health and attitudes towards others and society (e.g., peace and reconciliation) 
on both an individual and communal scale. I am particularly interested in how community-level responses may affect individuals in these 
contexts. Additionally, I am interested in partnering with communities and community-based organizations to empower them to answer 
the questions they have in their particular contexts so they can more effectively fulfill their mission. 
Most of my work has been conducted in Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
