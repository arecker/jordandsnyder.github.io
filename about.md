This is my academic website, where you can find information on my current research and some of my experiences doing the work that I am. I will be moving up to Alaska to complete an APA-Accredited Internship at the Alaska VA Healthcare System.

My current research agenda explores how exteI am a 5th year doctoral candidate studying clinical psychology at Wheaton College (IL).  My research interests include global mental health, attitudes towards others and society (e.g., peace and reconciliation), and community-based work with conflict-affected populations.  Most of my work has been conducted in Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy outdoor activities, programming and coding, and cooking.
