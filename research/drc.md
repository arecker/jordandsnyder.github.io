The eastern Democratic Republic of the Cong (DRC) has been in a state of protracted
conflict for the past 20 years. Rates of exposure to potentially traumatic events, as well as
psychological distress (i.e., depressive symptoms, post-traumatic stress symptoms, general
psychological distress) are elevated in studies in the population of the Eastern DRC.
Conservation of Resources (COR) theory posits that psychological distress is caused when
resources (e.g., financial resources, social support, sense of hope, self-efficacy) are lost,
threatened, or not gained after resource investment. COR theory has received much empirical
support in the wake of traumatic events. Specifically, loss of resources has been demonstrated to
be related to psychological distress due to traumatic events such as natural disasters (e.g.,
hurricanes or earthquakes), terrorism (e.g., September 11th), and protracted conflict (e.g., in
Israel and Palestine). COR theory and resource loss has been assessed in various contexts and
cultures, but has never been quantitatively examined in the eastern DRC. This secondary data analysis investigates resource loss and its effects on psychological distress (i.e., depressive
symptoms, post-traumatic stress symptoms, general psychological distress) in a sample of
Congolese adults living in the North Kivu region of the Eastern DRC.
