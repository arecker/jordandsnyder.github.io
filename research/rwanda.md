Can reconciliation occur between perpetrators and survivors of the 1994 Rwandan genocide? Christian Action for Reconciliation and Social Assistance (CARSA), a faith-based organization founded in 2002 in Rwanda, developed and is currently implementing an intervention, Cows For Peace (CFP), that seeks to foster trauma healing and reconciled relationships between genocide survivors and their direct perpetrators. CFP has three distinct programmatic arms including trauma-healing and forgiveness workshops based upon EMPOWER workshops, support groups for perpetrator-survivor pairs  called cell groups, and cooperative cow raising by selected perpetrator-survivor pairs. CARSAâ€™s CFP program rests upon the theories of Conflict Transformation (Lederach, 1997) and Intergroup Contact Theory (Allport, 1954; Pettigrew, 1998) to bring about restored relationships of trust and mutuality amongst survivors and their direct perpetrators. The EMPOWER workshop allows the perpetrators and survivors to renew contact in a safe environment of trust while fostering the development of coping skills. The cell groups, which are self-led groups of survivor-perpetrator pairs, allow for survivor-perpetrator pairs to continue the journey of reconciliation whilst supporting each other. Finally, the cooperative cow raising portion of the program allows for pairs to engage in superordinate goals to foster increased reconciliation and healing. CARSA partners with local leaders and communities to implement CFP in the sectors that it works with to bring reconciliation to the communities of Rwanda.
