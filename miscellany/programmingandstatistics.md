I am increasing interested in learning [R](https://www.r-project.org/) as a way to help answer questions that communities and organizations have in their unique contexts. Ultimately, I ended up conducting my own dissertation in R to further learn more about programming.  I am increasing interested in other tools that will equip me to help communities and organizations, including learning more about R, Python, and programming and statistics in general.
